## Step-by-Step Development Guide

### Phase 1: Project Initialization

1. **Set Up the Development Environment**

   - Install **Node.js** (v14 or later) and **npm**.
   - Install a code editor like **Visual Studio Code**.

2. **Initialize the Next.js Project**

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest youtube-second-brain
   cd youtube-second-brain
   ```

3. **Configure TypeScript**

   - Convert to TypeScript for type safety.

   ```bash
   touch tsconfig.json
   npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Install and Configure Tailwind CSS**

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

   - Configure `tailwind.config.js` and include Tailwind directives in your main CSS file.

5. **Initialize Git Repository and Deploy to Vercel**

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

   - Install the Vercel CLI and deploy:

     ```bash
     npm install -g vercel
     vercel
     ```

### Phase 2: Front-End Development

1. **Design the UI**

   - Create a component for uploading local video files.
   - Include an area to display analysis results.

2. **Implement File Upload Component**

   - Use the HTML `<input type="file" />` element.
   - Accept video file formats (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mov`).
   - Use React's `useState` hook to manage the uploaded file.

3. **Handle File Selection**

   - Read the selected file using the FileReader API.
   - Display the file name and size in the UI.

4. **Set Up State Management**

   - Use the React Context API to manage global state for the uploaded video and analysis results.

### Phase 3: Back-End Development

1. **Create API Route for Video Processing**

   - In `pages/api`, create `process-video.ts`.

     ```typescript
     // pages/api/process-video.ts

     import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

     export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
       if (req.method === 'POST') {
         // TODO: Process the video file
         res.status(200).json({ message: 'Video processing started' });
       } else {
         res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Integrate ffmpeg.wasm**

   - Install **ffmpeg.wasm**:

     ```bash
     npm install @ffmpeg/ffmpeg @ffmpeg/core
     ```

   - Initialize ffmpeg in your API route or a dedicated utility file.

3. **Extract Video Frames and Audio**

   - Use ffmpeg to extract frames at set intervals.
   - Extract audio from the video file.

4. **Limitations on Vercel**

   - Note: Vercel's serverless functions have limitations on execution time and resource usage.
   - For heavy processing tasks, consider processing on the client side or optimizing the workload.

### Phase 4: Content Analysis

1. **Client-Side Processing with TensorFlow.js**

   - Install TensorFlow.js:

     ```bash
     npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
     ```

2. **Visual Content Analysis**

   - Use pre-trained models available in TensorFlow.js, such as MobileNet or Coco SSD.
   - Perform image classification and object detection on extracted frames.

3. **Audio Content Analysis**

   - Use Web APIs to perform speech-to-text transcription.
   - Alternatively, integrate with a free speech-to-text API with limited usage.

4. **Text Content Analysis with LangChain**

   - Install LangChain:

     ```bash
     npm install langchain
     ```

   - Process transcribed text to extract entities and topics.
   - Use language models to summarize or analyze the text.

### Phase 5: Knowledge Base Setup

1. **Integrate a Lightweight Database**

   - Use **lowdb** for simplicity:

     ```bash
     npm install lowdb
     ```

   - Set up a JSON file to store data.

2. **Set Up FAISS for Vector Embeddings**

   - Install a JavaScript implementation of FAISS or use a local vector store compatible with your environment.

3. **Store Analysis Results**

   - Save visual analysis data, transcriptions, and embeddings to the database.
   - Index embeddings for efficient retrieval.

### Phase 6: Query System

1. **Develop the Query Interface**

   - Add a search bar to the front end for user queries.

2. **Process Queries with LangChain**

   - On query submission, send the query to an API route for processing.
   - Use LangChain to interpret the query and perform semantic search using embeddings.

3. **Retrieve and Display Information**

   - Fetch relevant data from the knowledge base.
   - Display insights, related frames, and transcriptions to the user.

### Phase 7: Enhancements and Optimization

1. **Improve Performance**

   - Optimize TensorFlow.js models by reducing input sizes or using quantized models.
   - Limit the number of frames processed.

2. **Enhance the User Interface**

   - Provide loading indicators during processing.
   - Display results in a user-friendly format.

3. **Implement Error Handling**

   - Validate file types and sizes.
   - Catch and display processing errors to the user.

4. **Write Documentation**

   - Create a README file with instructions on how to use the app.
   - Document any limitations or considerations.
